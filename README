Lately I've been spending a lot of time thinking about stripes.  I guess I'm dreaming of fall sweater knitting and all of the wonderful stripey possibilities.
	
The project striper lets you make stripes using your project photos.  So, if you have project yarn leftovers, you can see how they will stripe up.
	
You click on a photo thumbnail, which opens a dialog.  The dialog allows to select the 20px space on your photo you want to use as a swatch.  You then select a swatch and a number of rows to add a stripe.

This represents one day of coding work.  In time, I would like to have this tool reference stash photos instead of project photos, and I would like to add the ability to delete and insert stripes.  I would also like to add download functionality so you can save and compare stripey variations.

This project is written in PHP and uses jQuery and the canvas tag for image manipulation.
